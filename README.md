This is a simple project that allows users to generate simple avatar images for use in things that need icons.

## How To Do ##
Really you need an explanation? There's like 3 inputs on the page, man. I mean I guess.  
The inputs are defaulted to some stuff and shows the image for that. You can change the input and choose to "Do Things" and it will regenerate an image and show you the result. Clicking the little download button will (stick with me now) **download** the image. Amazing, the beauty of science!
